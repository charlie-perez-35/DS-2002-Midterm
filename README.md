# DS-2002-Midterm
Files and final code for my midterm project. I did not know how to cite the sample data I used from MongoDB Atlas as it was preloaded when I created an account. I used the .movies table from the Sample Mflix dataset. The customers-1000.csv file was pulled from https://www.datablist.com/learn/csv/download-sample-csv-files#people-dataset.
