# DS-2002-Midterm
Files and final code for my midterm project. I did not know how to cite the sample data I used from MongoDB Atlas as it was preloaded when I created an account. I used the .movies table from the Sample Mflix dataset. The customers-1000.csv file was pulled from https://www.datablist.com/learn/csv/download-sample-csv-files#people-dataset. All code is contained within the Jupyter notebook ('midterm_project_final_code.ipynb') except for the date dimension creation code, which is a separate SQL file ('sakila_dim_date_create.sql'). Note that the date dimension creation script must be run after the creation of the sakila_datawarehouse code (code section 3 in the notebook) or else it will not populate into the sakila datawarehouse. This is also noted in my markdowns in the Jupyter notebook. Other than that, no bugs were encountered when I ran this. Though the SQL connection uses a local connection (I am unclear of the implications this has for testing purposes), the MongoDB Compass connection should be open to anyone with the username and password provided in the Jupyter notebook.
